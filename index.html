                Made in Korea, moved to Virginia at age of 6. Went to grade school in New York, middle and high school in New Jersey. Spent too many hours after school in the arcade kicking ass at Street Fighter until my parents found out and was barred from playing. Studied econ, not sure why, in Illinois near the farms of Champaign. College was great but classes got in the way. Took CS105 intro to visual basics sophomore year and absolutely hated it; got a C and never wanted to touch CS again. Needless to say I was a bit hesitant about a coding bootcamp. Got my first computer junior year and used it to play starcraft instead of something more productive, but I was too good to not play. Picked up golf that same year and became addicted. Shot an 82 by second season and thought I was pro bound but after several years in I quickly realized I'd be broke long before I'd even find out if I was good enough. Longest drives of 340 isn't consistent enough distance and direction to be able to shoot in the 70s; hope is not lost but on hold for now. Then came along online poker.  Learned to play 24 tables and thought I was gonna make bank until black friday banned it in the states.  In retrospect the tracking software was more fascinating than poker itself.  Spent some time trading stocks with some good outcome. 90+ percent of trades in the green but gave a chunk back to the market after a friend recommended derivatives as the only way to hit it big.  Won't touch options again unless it's for the purpose of hedging positions. Turns out time decay is extremely important. One takeaway was less risk aversion which led me to crypto fairly early and still trading it. Unfortunately there isn't too much action currently in the crypto market so positions are usually sitting in tether while knowing that there's a possibility of exchanges getting hacked. Registered for RBC in order to learn how to learn coding and the way things generally works. Tech is now interesting and potential seems uncapped after guys like Jack Dorsey brought light to it. Several people tried to persuade me not to waste my money with bootcamp because coding is too difficult, which actually promoted a greater inclination to enroll.  Ironically, as dull as coding appears, I'd like to know more.<p>
